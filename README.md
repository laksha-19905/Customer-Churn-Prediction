# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. 
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s services. 
By identifying churn-prone customers, businesses can take preventive actions to improve retention.

## Dataset Used
Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
The dataset contains customer details such as:
- Gender
- Senior citizen status
- Contract type
- Monthly charges
- Tenure
- Payment method
- Churn status (Yes/No)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier

## Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Handled missing values and data type issues
3. Encoded categorical variables
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained machine learning models
6. Evaluated models using Accuracy and ROC-AUC score
7. Analyzed feature importance

## Results
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression
- ROC-AUC score indicates good prediction capability
- Model successfully identifies churn-prone customers

## Business Insights
- Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Longer customer tenure reduces churn
- Contract type and tenure are key factors affecting churn

## Conclusion
The Customer Churn Prediction model helps businesses identify customers likely to leave.
Using this model, companies can improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.
