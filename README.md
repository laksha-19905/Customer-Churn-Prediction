# Employee Attrition Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee data and predict employee attrition.
Employee attrition refers to employees leaving an organization.
By predicting attrition, companies can take proactive steps to improve employee retention.

## Dataset Used
IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Dataset

The dataset includes employee information such as:
- Age
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Job Satisfaction
- Overtime
- Work-Life Balance
- Attrition status (Yes/No)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier

## Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Removed unnecessary columns
3. Encoded categorical variables
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Applied feature scaling for Logistic Regression
6. Trained machine learning models
7. Evaluated models using Accuracy and ROC-AUC score
8. Analyzed feature importance

## Results
- Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression
- The model effectively predicts employees likely to leave the organization
- ROC-AUC score indicates good model performance

## Key Insights
- Employees working overtime are more likely to leave
- Low job satisfaction increases attrition
- Monthly income and job role significantly impact attrition
- Work-life balance plays a major role in employee retention

## Conclusion
Employee Attrition Analysis helps organizations identify risk factors that lead to employee turnover.
Using machine learning models, companies can implement better HR strategies to retain employees and reduce attrition.
